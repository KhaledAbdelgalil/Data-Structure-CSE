a)true as parent is greater than children so it's maxHeap
b)Note:depth of a node is number of edges from this node till root but height of tree is the max depth
false it's range from 2^n till 2^(n+1)-1
c)true:O(logn) as distance from any root to any leaf on average is logn
d)true: as it's better in case of non balanced tree.
e)false as selection sort is bigO(n^2) while merge sort is bigO(nlogn)
f)True: as heapSort doesn't require any extraSpace it also takes advantage of mergeSort in O(nlogn) in time and advangte of insertion sort in space:doesn't need extra space
g)true no. of swaps has order(n^2) selection they are just n
h)true:to satisfy heap property
i)false O(n) as we traverese till previous of last element in case of single linked list
j) false not always true as we it may be parent to left child and doesn't have a right child
